      Penalty for the Good Corporation: what will happen to Google and others
      for violating the GDPR
    </h2>
    <span class="container-post__item">September 29</span>
    <p class="container-post__text">
      On January 21, the French National Data Protection Commission (CNIL)
      announced on its website that it had fined Google for violating the EU's
      General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It took six months for the EU
      countries to make a quality level-up in the amount of fines for
      non-compliance with this standard. Prior to that, the fine was mainly €
      20,000-30,000, with the largest fine amounting to € 400,000 and related to
      a hospital in Portugal. But this precedent is interesting not so much the
      amount of the fine as the rigidity of the regulator's approaches. Denis
      Beregovyi, Axon Partners, explains why, especially for Mind.

    <p class="container-post__text">
      For what? The group complaints against Google arrived at CNIL on the same
      day that the GDPR came into force. The complainants reported that Google
      processed users' personal data without due cause, in particular to create
      personalized advertising offers.

    To the attention of Ukrainian security officers: the inspection was
    conducted online, without searches, without seizure of servers or other
    visible interference for business. And so it was possible.

    According to the results of CNIL inspections revealed violations of two
    requirements of the GDPR:

        Lack of proper user consent for the processing of personal data for the
        purpose of personalizing advertising.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="container-post__text--mod">
      In the case of personalization of advertising, Google was sure to obtain
      the consent of users, because, firstly, when creating Google accounts, the
      user agrees to the Privacy Policy, and secondly, Google has a section "Ads
      personalization", where you can disable this feature.

      <p class="section-post__text-mod">
        However, CNIL does not think so, because the information about the
        personalization of advertising is not clear enough to users. As an
        example, the Commission claims that the relevant "Personalization"
        window does not contain information on the full range of Google services
        that collect and process personal data for this purpose (YouTube, Google
        search, Play Store, Google pictures, Gmail, etc.). ), and therefore, the
        user cannot realize to what extent the data is used and how exactly they
        can be combined.

        So, let's walk through the text of the CNIL decision
      </h2>
      <p class="section-post__text">
        Why France and not Ireland. Google operates in Europe through a legal
        entity in Ireland. But the case was not initiated by the Irish, but by
        the French regulator. This is why it happened.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="section-post__text">
        If data processing decisions are taken anywhere outside the EU, there is
        a one-stop mechanism - where the complaint is received, the body
        considers it. Because Google's data processing center is located in the
        United States and the complaint was first received in France, CNIL
        considered it.
